# COVID19-and-Mental-Health-in-Singapore
A dashboard consisting of interactive data visualisations and articles that contribute to the cause for mental health.

Completing this project would be a way for me to research on the mental health scene in Singapore. I feel that the country does not often speak about it, especially by those of more traditional generations. I was raised by a family who never spoke of looking after one's mental state and empathising with others. The internet was my source of knowledge when I was younger, and still is.

Furthermore, with this dashboard, I am able to share with others what I know from my research. This can potentially bring up more conversation regarding mental health, which encourages individuals to take action. With my skills, I aim to delve deeper into mental health and contribute to this cause.
